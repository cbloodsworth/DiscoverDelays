# DiscoverDelays
Project 3 for DSA

Add 
#include "Visuals.h"
to the top of your main. 

Ensure that Visuals.h is in the same folder as your main.cpp.
Ensure that the folder "Images" is contained in the same folder as your main.cpp. The images folder must be in the same folder as the executable, when it comes time to make that.

Unfortunately, in order to debug the project, an installation of SFML is required and importing into the IDE of choice. This is a pain, but you only
need to do it once per project.
